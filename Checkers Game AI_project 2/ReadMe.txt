Step 3: 
--------
After selecting the interaction.
Press 2 from the main menu to select the algorithm type for game,
  for Player1 and Player2.

1. for AlphaBeta search algorithm
2. for MinimaxAB algorithm

Step 4: 
--------
After selecting the algorithm for each player.
Press 3 from the main menu to select the evaluation function for game,
  for Player1 and Player2, as supporting evalution functions for respective algorithm selection.

 
Step 5:
